# Third-party projects

## [Tweaks](https://github.com/nitrowinproject/Tweaks)

My tweaks are licensed under the [Zero-Clause-BSD license](https://github.com/nitrowinproject/Tweaks/blob/main/LICENSE).

However, note that most tweaks used in this project were originally created by AtlasOS. Although they have been converted into a more standard format, I decided to keep the [GPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/LICENSE). For more details, check out the [Tweaks repository](https://github.com/nitrowinproject/Tweaks).
