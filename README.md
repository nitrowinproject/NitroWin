## :books: · How do I use this?

> [!WARNING]
> The Pro or LTSC versions of Windows are recommended because I've had problems with the Home editions of Windows.

Go to the [latest GitHub release page](https://github.com/nitrowinproject/NitroWin/releases/latest) and download autounattend.xml.

Create your Windows installation media as you usually would.

Copy the autounattend.xml file to the root of your installation media.

> [!TIP]
> Open the root folder in your installation media and create the NitroWin.Apps.txt file. Customize it to your liking, using [this guide](docs/config.md).

Install Windows as you usually would. NitroWin will then apply its tweaks automatically.

It is recommended to use WinUtil and OOSU after installing.
