## :books: · How do I use this?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install the [.NET 8.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) if you haven't already. You only need the desktop or the normal runtime, not both.

Go to the [latest GitHub release page](https://github.com/nitrowinproject/NitroWin/releases/latest) and download NitroWin.zip from there and extract it.

Create your Windows installation media as you usually would. Run the NitroWin executable and answer all prompts.

Open the new NitroWin folder in your installation media and open the Apps.txt file. Customize it to your liking, using [this guide](docs/config.md).

Install Windows as usual (Pro is recommended).

After installing Windows, run the NitroWin.Installer executable and accept all UAC prompts.

It is recommended to use WinUtil and OOSU after installing.
