## :books: How do I use this?

> [!CAUTION]
> The Pro and Enterprise versions of Windows are recommended because the Home editions of Windows do not support Group Policies.

> [!NOTE]
> If no configuration is found, NitroWin will use the default one. If you do not like it, customize it to your liking using the [Configuration Page](https://niitroo.codeberg.page/).

> [!TIP]
> Check out [this guide](docs/vm.md) for running NitroWin inside a virtual machine.

1. Download the [latest version of the answer file](https://github.com/nitrowinproject/NitroWin/releases/latest/download/autounattend.xml).

2. Copy it to the root of your installation media.

3. Install Windows as usual.

4. (Optional, but highly recommended) Use [WinUtil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil) and [OOSU](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10) for even better privacy.
